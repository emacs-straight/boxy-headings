   To view all headings in an org-mode file as a boxy diagram, use
   the interactive function =boxy-headings=

   Suggested keybinding:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c r o") 'boxy-headings)
   #+end_src

   To modify the relationship between a headline and its parent, add
   the property REL to the child headline. Valid values are:
   - on-top
   - in-front
   - behind
   - above
   - below
   - right
   - left

   The tooltip for each headline shows the values that would be
   displayed if the org file was in org columns view.
